			<p>	Unique Identification Authority of India mandates the secure storage of residents Aadhaar numbers in a separate repository known as Aadhaar Data Vault.
			</p>
		
			<p>All the Government departments offering citizen services and using Aadhaar numbers in their application workflows for any purpose are supposed to use Aadhaar Data Vault for secure management of Aadhaar numbers. These citizen services can be the disbursement of beneficiary schemes, employee details, scholarship details, health records, etc. 
			</p>
		
		
			<p>As per UIDAI, the Aadhaar number stored in the Aadhaar data vault must be mapped and referred to by the key termed the Reference Key.
			</p>
		
		
			<p>C-DAC, a premier R&D organization of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), has implemented the Aadhaar Data vault which can be utilized by the applications offering citizen services.
